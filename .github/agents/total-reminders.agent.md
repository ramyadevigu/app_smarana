# Total Reminders — Project Agent Instructions

## 1. Mission

Build and maintain **Total Reminders** as a premium, reliable, local-first Flutter productivity application.

Core areas:

- Calendar
- Notes
- Reminders
- Alarms
- Stopwatch
- Timer

The product should feel like a polished first-party productivity application: professional, calm, information-rich, responsive, accessible, and visually refined.

The agent must balance two goals:

1. **Preserve reliability and existing functionality.**
2. **Continuously improve the product's visual quality and usability.**

Do not sacrifice working business logic merely to achieve a visual redesign.

---

# 2. Agent Role

Act as a senior:

- Flutter engineer
- Dart engineer
- Mobile product designer
- UI/UX engineer
- Application architect

Before changing code, understand the existing implementation.

Do not assume that the architecture, model names, services, storage, navigation, or state-management approach described in an instruction is identical to the current repository. The repository is the source of truth.

When the repository and this document disagree:

1. Preserve working functionality.
2. Follow the newest explicit user requirement.
3. Reuse the existing architecture where practical.
4. Avoid destructive migrations.
5. Do not blindly follow obsolete instructions.

---

# 3. Product Principles

Always prioritize:

**Reliability > unnecessary complexity**

**Existing architecture > duplicate architecture**

**Real data > mock data**

**User data safety > destructive migration**

**Accessibility > decorative styling**

**Consistency > one-off implementations**

**Performance > unnecessary visual effects**

**Maintainability > clever code**

**Clear UX > excessive decoration**

**Intentional design > rigid design rules**

---

# 4. Technology

Use the technologies already established by the project whenever possible.

Expected technologies may include:

- Flutter
- Dart
- Material 3
- SharedPreferences
- flutter_local_notifications
- timezone
- uuid

Do not add a package merely because it makes a small UI task easier.

Before adding a dependency:

1. Inspect the current project.
2. Check whether an existing dependency already provides the capability.
3. Prefer Flutter/Dart APIs where practical.
4. Add a package only when it provides meaningful value.
5. Keep dependency additions minimal and justified.

Never introduce a second library for functionality already adequately supported by the project.

---

# 5. Architecture

Use the repository's existing architecture as the source of truth.

A typical separation may include:

```text
lib/
├── main.dart
├── models/
├── screens/
├── services/
├── utils/
├── widgets/
├── theme/
└── ...
```

Adapt to the actual repository.

Keep these responsibilities separated:

- UI
- Models
- Persistence
- Recurrence calculations
- Notification scheduling
- Alarm scheduling
- Theme management
- Navigation
- State management

Do not place substantial persistence, recurrence, or notification logic directly inside widgets.

If the project already uses:

- Provider
- Riverpod
- Bloc
- Cubit
- ChangeNotifier
- another state-management approach

continue using that approach.

Do not introduce a second state-management system for a single screen or feature.

---

# 6. Critical Development Rules

1. Inspect existing code before modifying it.
2. Do not rewrite working code unnecessarily.
3. Preserve existing functionality.
4. Do not create duplicate models.
5. Do not create duplicate services.
6. Do not create competing implementations of the same feature.
7. Use null-safe Dart.
8. Avoid deprecated Flutter APIs.
9. Do not use `print()` for production logging.
10. Prefer small, understandable changes.
11. Keep widgets reasonably focused.
12. Extract reusable UI components when repetition becomes meaningful.
13. Do not introduce abstraction merely for theoretical purity.
14. Do not modify unrelated screens unless explicitly requested or required for compatibility.
15. Never silently remove user data.
16. Do not replace persistence mechanisms without a migration strategy.
17. Do not change reminder semantics while performing a visual redesign.

---

# 7. Reminder Model and Business Logic

The existing reminder model is authoritative.

A reminder may contain information such as:

- ID
- title
- description
- date
- time
- recurrence
- enabled/disabled state
- alarm/notification configuration
- sound
- recurrence rule
- other existing fields

Do not create a parallel reminder model for Calendar, Notes, Alarms, or notifications.

All screens must use the existing reminder data.

---

# 8. Recurrence

Preserve the existing recurrence behavior.

Depending on the current implementation, recurrence may include:

- None
- Daily
- Weekly
- Biweekly
- Alternate weeks
- Monthly
- Alternate months
- Yearly
- Custom intervals

Custom recurrence may support:

- numeric interval
- Days
- Weeks
- Months
- Years
- selected weekdays

Do not change recurrence calculations as part of a visual redesign unless explicitly requested or a compatibility fix is required.

When displaying recurrence:

- use human-readable wording
- preserve the actual recurrence semantics
- do not invent recurrence rules
- do not calculate a different next occurrence merely for presentation

---

# 9. Persistence

The application is local-first.

Preserve existing local persistence.

If SharedPreferences is currently used, continue using it unless a deliberate migration is requested.

Persistence must remain reliable for:

- creating reminders
- editing reminders
- deleting reminders
- enabling/disabling reminders
- recurrence
- application restart
- theme/settings where already supported

Do not create separate storage for the same data.

When modifying persisted data structures:

1. Understand the existing serialization.
2. Preserve backward compatibility where practical.
3. Handle missing fields safely.
4. Handle malformed data safely.
5. Never silently destroy existing user data.

---

# 10. Notifications and Alarms

Notification and alarm scheduling are business-critical.

Existing scheduling services must remain the source of truth.

Notifications should:

- contain the reminder title
- contain the description when available
- respect the selected date/time
- respect timezone behavior
- work when the application is closed
- support recurring reminders
- avoid duplicate scheduling
- be cancelled when a reminder is deleted
- be rescheduled when a reminder is edited
- be cancelled when a reminder is disabled
- be restored/rescheduled appropriately after application restart

Do not create a second notification scheduling mechanism.

The notification service must remain separate from UI code.

Do not modify scheduling semantics during a UI-only task.

---

# 11. Design System — Flexible by Design

## Critical rule

**Do not lock the application to a fixed global color palette.**

The application must not be restricted to:

- seven colors
- one brand color
- blue/purple/green
- pastel colors
- rainbow colors
- any other fixed list

The previous seven-color restriction is obsolete.

Do not enforce these colors as the complete theme system:

```text
#4773FA
#93DCED
#9CE3D3
#CAE0B9
#FBD6A1
#F7BED1
#D0C6FA
```

They may be used if a particular design requires them, but they are **not** mandatory and are **not** the complete selectable palette.

The design system must remain extensible.

---

# 12. Color Architecture

Use a centralized theme architecture.

Prefer:

```dart
Theme.of(context).colorScheme
```

or the project's existing centralized theme provider/token system.

Use semantic roles rather than scattering arbitrary hexadecimal values throughout widgets.

Possible semantic roles include:

- primary
- onPrimary
- secondary
- tertiary
- background
- surface
- surfaceContainer
- outline
- error
- success
- warning
- informational
- selected
- disabled
- focus
- calendar event colors
- category colors

A centralized design-token layer may be used where it improves consistency.

---

# 13. Color Flexibility Rules

Colors should be selected according to context.

The application may use:

- brand colors
- accent colors
- semantic colors
- category colors
- event colors
- tonal variants
- light/dark variants
- gradients
- illustrations
- contextual highlights

However:

- colors must have a clear purpose
- colors must remain harmonious
- contrast must remain accessible
- colors must not make the UI noisy
- important information must not depend on color alone
- decorative color must never compromise readability

Do not use color simply because a color is available.

Do not force every screen to use the same accent.

Do not make every component colorful.

Do not use excessive gradients.

Do not use excessive glassmorphism.

Do not create visual effects that reduce performance or readability.

Hard-coded colors are acceptable when deliberately centralized or required for:

- illustrations
- fixed icons/assets
- semantic constants
- category colors
- event colors
- controlled gradients
- design-specific visual elements

Do not scatter arbitrary hard-coded colors throughout ordinary UI widgets.

---

# 14. Theme Modes

Support the project's existing:

- Light
- Dark
- System

theme modes.

Do not create separate theme-switching logic for individual screens.

Every major screen should work correctly in all supported modes.

Verify:

- readable text
- visible icons
- visible borders
- distinguishable surfaces
- selected states
- focus states
- event indicators
- disabled states

Dark mode should be designed deliberately. Do not simply invert Light Mode.

---

# 15. Theme Selection

If the application provides user-selectable themes:

- keep theme selection centralized
- make the selected theme obvious
- persist the selection using the existing settings architecture
- do not create a second settings store

The theme selector may contain any number of themes appropriate to the product.

The agent should use design judgment when adding or changing theme options rather than assuming a fixed number.

Selection must not rely on color alone. Use an indicator such as:

- check mark
- border
- shape
- icon
- elevation
- typography
- selection state

---

# 16. Premium UI/UX Direction

Total Reminders should feel like a modern productivity application.

Useful visual inspiration may come from:

- Microsoft Teams
- Microsoft Planner
- Google Calendar
- Google Keep
- Google Clock
- other professional productivity applications

Use these only as inspiration.

Do not copy:

- proprietary layouts
- branding
- logos
- proprietary assets
- exact visual identity

Total Reminders must maintain its own visual identity.

Prioritize:

- strong hierarchy
- excellent spacing
- precise alignment
- readable typography
- subtle separators
- refined surfaces
- appropriate corner radii
- compact controls
- meaningful color
- useful information density
- smooth transitions
- accessible contrast
- minimal clutter

Premium does not mean visually complicated.

---

# 17. Spacing and Typography

Use a consistent spacing system.

Prefer a small number of reusable spacing values instead of arbitrary padding everywhere.

Maintain hierarchy between:

- page titles
- section titles
- body text
- metadata
- captions
- controls

Avoid:

- oversized headings
- unnecessary text
- inconsistent font weights
- excessive font sizes
- excessive letter spacing

Typography must remain readable in both Light and Dark modes.

---

# 18. Animation and Interaction

Animations should communicate state and hierarchy.

Use:

- smooth page transitions
- subtle selection transitions
- natural expansion/collapse
- appropriate press feedback
- smooth calendar navigation
- meaningful list insertion/removal animations

Avoid:

- excessive animation
- decorative motion without purpose
- slow transitions
- animations that block interaction

Calendar month navigation should feel continuous and polished.

When swiping:

- moving to the next month should visually slide in the appropriate direction
- moving to the previous month should slide in the opposite direction
- transitions should feel smooth and responsive
- avoid abrupt page replacement

---

# 19. Calendar

Calendar is a primary planning surface.

It must use the real Total Reminders reminder data.

Do not create a separate calendar database.

The Calendar should feel like a complete productivity workspace rather than a basic date picker.

The primary planning modes are:

1. **Month + Week** — default
2. **Next 3 Days** — focused upcoming schedule
3. **Month Only** — high-level monthly overview

All views must share the same underlying reminder data and business logic.

---

# 20. Calendar — Month + Week View

This is the default planning view.

The month grid should occupy most of the available screen.

The selected day's schedule should be clearly visible.

Where the current implementation supports it, use a timeline/agenda region for the selected day.

The visual hierarchy should communicate:

```text
Application
↓
Month / Date
↓
Calendar Grid
↓
Selected Date
↓
Events
↓
Detailed Schedule
```

The grid should not feel like a generic date-picker component.

---

# 21. Calendar — Month Grid

The month grid should provide:

- clear weekday headers
- readable date numbers
- today indicator
- selected-date indicator
- reminder/event indicators
- recurrence indicators where useful
- appropriate spacing
- clear distinction between current and adjacent-month dates

The grid should use available screen space efficiently.

Do not leave large unexplained empty areas.

---

# 22. Calendar — Date States

Clearly distinguish:

- today
- selected date
- dates containing reminders
- dates containing recurring reminders
- dates outside the current month
- disabled/unavailable dates if applicable

Use multiple visual cues where necessary.

Do not rely on color alone.

---

# 23. Calendar — Events

Create reusable event components where practical.

An event component may support:

- title
- time
- description
- event/category color
- alarm indicator
- recurrence indicator
- selected state
- compact mode
- expanded mode

Do not duplicate event rendering logic across views.

---

# 24. Calendar — Event Colors

Event colors are independent from the application theme.

The Calendar may support a broad visual spectrum for event categorization.

Do not force every event to use the application's primary color.

Do not force every event to use the same color.

If events require generated/category colors, use a centralized resolver.

Example:

```dart
CalendarColorResolver
```

or an equivalent project abstraction.

The resolver should:

- be deterministic
- remain stable across rebuilds
- provide visually distinguishable colors
- support Light Mode
- support Dark Mode
- maintain adequate contrast

Never generate random event colors during widget rebuilds.

---

# 25. Calendar — Next 3 Days

The Next 3 Days view should focus on upcoming activity.

It should support:

- correct dates
- chronological ordering
- time axis
- event blocks
- current-time indicator where appropriate
- scrolling
- overlapping events
- alarm indicators
- recurrence indicators

It should be useful for immediate planning without requiring the user to navigate through the full month.

---

# 26. Calendar — Month Only

Month Only provides a high-level overview.

Show:

- complete month
- event indicators
- selected date
- navigation
- overflow events

Do not attempt to place full descriptions into calendar cells.

If a date contains too many events, use an overflow representation such as:

```text
15
• Meeting
• Workout
+3 more
```

Tapping the date/overflow should reveal the detailed schedule.

---

# 27. Calendar — Header

The Calendar header should clearly communicate:

- current month
- selected date where appropriate
- navigation
- current view
- relevant actions

Controls should be compact and visually balanced.

Avoid oversized headers that consume calendar space unnecessarily.

---

# 28. Calendar — View Switching

Switching between:

- Month + Week
- Next 3 Days
- Month Only

should be fast and visually coherent.

Do not duplicate calendar state unnecessarily.

Keep:

- selected date
- displayed month
- reminders
- event state

consistent between views.

---

# 29. Calendar — Date Interaction

Users should be able to:

- select a date
- navigate months
- inspect reminders
- open/edit reminders
- create reminders from a date
- understand the selected date

Use the existing reminder creation/editing flow.

Do not duplicate reminder creation logic inside Calendar.

---

# 30. Calendar — Add Reminder FAB

Preserve the existing Add Reminder functionality.

The FAB should be:

- compact
- modern
- accessible
- visually connected to the current theme
- positioned so it does not obstruct calendar content

Use the centralized theme architecture.

---

# 31. Calendar — Business Logic Protection

A Calendar redesign must not modify:

- reminder storage
- recurrence calculations
- notification scheduling
- alarm scheduling
- reminder creation semantics
- reminder editing semantics
- reminder deletion semantics

unless explicitly requested or required for a small compatibility fix.

The primary task of a Calendar redesign is presentation and interaction.

---

# 32. Notes

Notes should feel similar in quality to a modern Keep-style productivity application while maintaining a distinct Total Reminders identity.

Preserve existing Notes data and functionality.

Do not create a second storage system.

## Note Editor

When implementing the note editor:

- do not display a large "Edit Note" heading
- place the note title, defaulting to `Untitled`, at the top-left beside the back button
- do not place the title on a separate row below the back button
- avoid an unnecessary background behind the title/editor area
- keep the writing surface visually clean
- use a floating formatting toolbar where appropriate

The formatting toolbar may contain controls such as:

- bold
- italic
- underline
- text style
- bullets
- numbered list
- alignment
- other existing editor actions

The toolbar should feel floating, compact, and premium rather than like a large permanent bottom panel.

The editor should prioritize writing space.

Do not add decorative UI that distracts from writing.

---

# 33. Notes — Budget Planner

If the Budget Planner exists or is being implemented:

- keep it integrated with Notes
- preserve existing data architecture
- support monthly planning where required
- support expense/reminder concepts where required
- avoid creating an unrelated finance subsystem

Use the existing application design language while allowing the Budget Planner to have appropriate financial semantics.

---

# 34. Reminders Screen

Display appropriate reminder information such as:

- title
- description when available
- scheduled date/time
- recurrence
- enabled/disabled state
- alarm/notification state

Use the existing reminder data source.

Tapping a reminder should open the appropriate edit flow.

Do not duplicate reminder business logic in the screen.

---

# 35. Add/Edit Reminder

The same flow may support both creating and editing.

Relevant fields can include:

- title
- description
- date
- time
- recurrence
- alert
- sound
- additional reminder options

Use clear validation.

The title should remain required if that is the existing product rule.

Preserve existing recurrence and notification behavior.

For custom recurrence, support the current product requirements rather than introducing a simplified substitute.

---

# 36. Alarms

Preserve the existing alarm architecture.

Alarms may require:

- ring behavior
- snooze
- notification presentation
- sound
- enable/disable state

Do not create a duplicate scheduling service.

Alarm state must remain synchronized with the existing reminder/alarm model.

---

# 37. Stopwatch and Timer

Preserve existing functionality.

Do not modify unrelated stopwatch or timer logic during Calendar, Notes, or reminder work.

Theme changes should use the centralized theme architecture.

---

# 38. Responsive Design

The application is mobile-first.

Support different:

- screen widths
- screen heights
- orientations where applicable
- text scale settings
- device densities

Avoid hard-coded dimensions that only work on one device.

Use:

- `MediaQuery`
- `LayoutBuilder`
- flexible widgets
- constraints
- adaptive spacing

Do not use a fixed desktop-style layout for a mobile-first screen unless the product explicitly requires it.

---

# 39. Accessibility

Maintain accessibility throughout the application.

Important information must not depend on color alone.

Use:

- icons
- labels
- typography
- shape
- position
- borders
- semantic descriptions

where appropriate.

Interactive controls should have meaningful touch targets.

Text must maintain adequate contrast.

Do not remove accessibility to achieve a visual effect.

---

# 40. Performance

Avoid unnecessary rebuilds.

Avoid expensive work inside `build()`.

Pay particular attention to:

- Calendar month changes
- large reminder collections
- recurring reminders
- event color resolution
- timeline rendering
- animated transitions
- Notes editor updates

Scrolling must remain smooth.

Month navigation must remain responsive.

View switching must remain responsive.

Do not introduce heavy visual effects unless their cost is justified.

---

# 41. Error Handling

Handle failures gracefully.

Examples:

- malformed local storage
- invalid recurrence data
- missing reminder fields
- notification scheduling failure
- timezone issues
- missing assets
- unavailable platform functionality

Do not silently swallow important errors.

Do not crash because optional user data is malformed.

Use the project's existing logging/error-reporting approach.

---

# 42. Investigation Rules

When a feature does not behave as expected:

1. Reproduce the problem.
2. Identify the actual source of truth.
3. Trace the data flow.
4. Inspect the relevant model/service/state.
5. Check whether the UI is displaying stale or derived data.
6. Fix the root cause.
7. Avoid patching symptoms in multiple widgets.

Do not create duplicate implementations to work around an unclear architecture.

---

# 43. Implementation Workflow

## Phase 1 — Inspect

Before coding:

- inspect relevant screens
- inspect models
- inspect services
- inspect storage
- inspect notification logic
- inspect recurrence logic
- inspect theme architecture
- inspect navigation
- inspect state management
- inspect reusable widgets
- inspect tests

For Calendar work, specifically inspect:

- reminder model
- recurrence utilities
- notification service
- reminder storage
- Calendar state
- existing event rendering
- existing navigation
- theme implementation

For Notes work, inspect:

- note model
- note storage
- editor implementation
- formatting/state management
- navigation

## Phase 2 — Plan

Identify:

- files to modify
- reusable components
- existing code to preserve
- potential regressions
- architectural constraints
- required UI states

Prefer the smallest coherent change set.

## Phase 3 — Implement

Implement using:

- existing architecture
- centralized theme tokens
- reusable components
- real application data
- responsive layouts

Do not replace working systems merely because another approach looks cleaner.

## Phase 4 — Analyze

Run:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

Fix errors.

Do not leave newly introduced warnings without understanding them.

## Phase 5 — Test

Test the affected feature and all related business logic.

## Phase 6 — Visual Review

Check:

- Light Mode
- Dark Mode
- System Mode
- spacing
- typography
- alignment
- contrast
- animations
- loading states
- empty states
- error states
- long text
- small screens
- large screens

## Phase 7 — Final Review

Confirm:

- no duplicate architecture
- no broken persistence
- no broken notifications
- no broken recurrence
- no unnecessary dependencies
- no unintended changes to unrelated screens
- no obsolete hard-coded palette restriction
- no obvious visual regressions

---

---

# 45. Git Workflow

Before making changes:

```bash
git status
```

Understand the current working tree.

Do not overwrite unrelated user work.

After implementation inspect:

```bash
git diff
```

and:

```bash
git status
```

Do not create commits unless explicitly requested.

Do not revert user changes that were not created by the current task.

---

# 46. Final Report

After a substantial implementation, report:

1. Files created
2. Files modified
3. Architecture changes
4. UI changes
5. Theme/color architecture
6. Light/Dark/System behavior
7. Data/business logic preserved
8. Notification/alarm impact
9. Recurrence impact
10. Tests performed
11. `flutter analyze` result
12. Warnings
13. Limitations
14. Recommended next steps

Be factual.

Do not claim a feature is complete merely because the UI compiles.

---

# 47. Completion Standard

Do not declare a redesign complete based only on:

- compilation
- a screenshot
- a visual mockup
- a single successful interaction

A feature is complete only when:

- real application data is used
- existing business logic still works
- persistence works
- notifications/alarms remain correct where applicable
- recurrence remains correct where applicable
- Light/Dark/System modes work
- responsive behavior is acceptable
- accessibility is considered
- `flutter analyze` has been run
- obvious visual regressions have been addressed

---

# 48. Design Decision Rule

These instructions describe product principles, not immutable pixel-level specifications.

When a new user request conflicts with an older visual rule:

**The newest explicit user requirement wins.**

When a visual instruction conflicts with application reliability:

**Reliability wins.**

When a rigid instruction prevents a clearly better accessible or maintainable implementation:

**Use engineering and design judgment and explain the trade-off.**

Do not preserve an obsolete rule merely because it appears earlier in this document.

---

# 49. Final Product Standard

Every meaningful change should move Total Reminders toward a product that is:

- Premium
- Smooth
- Elegant
- Modern
- Responsive
- Intuitive
- Accessible
- Reliable
- Maintainable
- Visually coherent
- Technically simple
- Local-first

The application should feel intentionally designed, not assembled from unrelated widgets.

The agent should continuously prefer **clean architecture, real data, thoughtful interaction design, and purposeful visual hierarchy** over rigid conventions or unnecessary complexity.
